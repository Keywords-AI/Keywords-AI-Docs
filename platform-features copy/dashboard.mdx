Keywords AI's [dashboard page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/dashboard) aggregates your API calls and traces them through time, making it easy to visually keep track of your API usage.

## Dashboard Components

### Metric Cards
On the top of the dashboard page, you will find these metric cards that give you a quick overview of your API usage.

Each card shows an aggregation of the metric and a small embedded chart that shows the trend of the metric over time.

### Display Metrics & Breakdown Controls
You can control the displays of the chart in the middle control bar

You can choose which chart to display and filter the requests in the graph by metrics.

By default, the chart traces the total aggregation of the selected metric through time. You can also choose the breakdown type to see the distribution of the metric by different aggregations.

## Example
Let's take a look at an example of seeing the latency of the API requests over the month with a breakdown by models

1. Select the `Latency` metric

2. Select the display timeline type to `Month`.

3. Select the breakdown type to `Model`.

Let's see the result:

Looks pretty good!

4. You can open the side panel to see the summary of the breakdown by clicking the icon on the right of the control bar:

Click open the side panel:

Great! You can try different combinations of metrics and breakdown types to learn more about your API usage.
