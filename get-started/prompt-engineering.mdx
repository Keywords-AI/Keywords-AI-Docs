## 1. Create a new prompt on the platform
Once you have signed up and created an account, you can create a new prompt on the platform. Go to the [Prompts page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/prompts) and click on the "Create new prompt" button. You should name your prompt and could add a description to it.

## 2. Configure your prompt
Once you have created a new prompt, you can configure it. Go to the `Editor` tab and you can begin to write your prompt. The right side of the screen defines your prompt. You can set parameters like `Model`, `Temperature`, `Max Tokens`, and `Top P`. You can also add function calls and fallback models to your prompt. Check out the details [here](/api-endpoints/async-endpoints/request-logging-endpoint).

## 3. Write the content of your prompt
Once you have configured your prompt, you can write the content of your prompt. Click on the `+ Add message` button to add a new message to your prompt. You can change the role of the message to `user` or `assistant` by clicking on the role name.

You can also add variables to your prompt. Variables are placeholders for dynamic content that can be used to generate prompts. Simply add double curly braces `{{variable_name}}` to your prompt and you will be able to use the variable in your prompt.

Replace the User message with this:
```
Please develop an optimized Python function to {{task_description}}, utilizing {{specific_library}}, include error handling, and write unit tests for the function.
```

After did this, you can:
1. Add a value for each variable in the `Variables` tab.
2. Click `Run` to test your prompt.

You now just finished writing your first version of the prompt.
## 4.Commit your first version
You can click on the `Commit` button and write a commit message, which is helpful for you to track the changes you made to your prompt.
