This guide will walk you through the process of migrating your existing prompts to Keywords AI's platform. By managing your prompts on Keywords AI, you'll benefit from version control, collaboration features, and enhanced monitoring capabilities.

## 1. Create a new prompt on the platform

To begin migrating your prompts, first create a new prompt on Keywords AI platform. Navigate to the [Prompts page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/prompts) and click "Create new prompt". Give it a name that matches your existing prompt and add a description to maintain context.

## 2. Configure your prompt settings

Transfer your existing prompt settings to Keywords AI. In the `Editor` tab, configure the same parameters you're currently using, such as:
- Model selection
- Temperature
- Max tokens
- Top P

For advanced configurations like function calls and fallback models, refer to our [Prompt engineering documentation](/features/prompt/create-a-prompt).

## 3. Migrate your prompt content

Now it's time to transfer your actual prompt content. Click `+ Add message` to recreate your prompt's conversation flow. Match each message's role (`user` or `assistant`) to your existing prompt structure.

If your current prompt uses variables, you can maintain the same functionality by using our variable syntax: `{{variable_name}}`. For example:

```
Please develop an optimized Python function to {{task_description}}, utilizing {{specific_library}}, include error handling, and write unit tests for the function.
```

Test your migrated prompt by:
1. Adding test values for your variables in the `Variables` tab
2. Clicking `Run` to verify the output matches your original promptt.

## 4.Commit your first version
After successfully migrating your prompt, commit it as your first version. Add a descriptive commit message like "Initial migration from [previous system]" to maintain a clear history of your prompt's origin.

Congratulations! You've successfully migrated your first prompt to Keywords AI.

{/* ## 5. Deploy your prompt

If you want to integrate the prompt into your application, you can deploy it. Here's how you can do it:

1. You should integrate keywords AI LLM proxy to your application. Check out the details [here](get-started/llm-inference). */}
