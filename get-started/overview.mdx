## Keywords AI: “The API Bartender”

Keywords AI API is a large language model (LLM) routing and monitoring tool. The API connects user requests to the best LLM for the task, optimizing for speed, response quality, cost and uptime reliability and monitoring the performance of the LLMs in real-time.

Keywords AI API brings the following benefits:

- **Enhanced Efficiency**: Achieve superior performance at reduced costs.
- **Continuous Adaptation**: Continuously upgrading Keywords AI API performance with the integration of the latest models.
- **Uptime Assurance**: Maintain enhanced uptime by steering clear of models with degraded performance.
- **Development Focus**: Concentrate on product enhancement, delegating the task of model optimization to Keywords AI.
- **Cost Optimization**: Minimize costs by leveraging the most cost-effective models for the task at hand.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Keep track of model performance in real-time, ensuring that the best models are always in use.
- **Ease of Updating**: Add or drop models as per your requirements, without any hassle.


## API Capabilities

### Pure Text Processing

The Keywords AI API can process any text-based input and generate a wide range of outputs. This includes but is not limited to:

- **Content Generation**: Creating high-quality written content for various purposes.
- **Data Analysis**: Extracting and interpreting key information from large volumes of text.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Comprehending and responding to user queries in a conversational manner.
- **Language Translation**: Offering accurate translations between multiple languages.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the sentiment behind text inputs, useful for customer feedback and social media monitoring.
- **Code Generation**: Assisting in software development by generating code snippets.
- **Educational Assistance**: Providing tutoring and educational content in a range of subjects.

### Image and Text Processing (NEW!!! 02/11/2024):

The Keywords AI API can now process image input: 

- **Image Captioning**: Generating captions for images.
- **Image Analysis**: Extracting information from images and interpreting it.

See the [input parameters page](/api-usage/request-params#llm-api-parameters) for more information.



## Monitoring

- **Real-time Performance Monitoring**: The API monitors key metrics like response latency, error rates, throughput, and resource usage for each LLM in real-time. This helps identify any degrading performance.
- **Post Generation Analysis**: The API can analyze the generated content and user sentiment to ensure that the content is of high quality and meets the user's expectations.
- **Automatic Model Selection**: Based on the monitored performance data, the API can automatically route traffic away from underperforming models and towards better models, ensuring top user experience.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Sophisticated algorithms help detect anomalies in a model's behavior that could indicate issues. This facilitates proactive resolution.
- **Reporting & Alerts**: Comprehensive reporting provides insights into long-term trends. Alerts can be set up to notify about SLA breaches or abnormal situations.
