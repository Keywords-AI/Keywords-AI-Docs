## Keywords AI Documentation

{/* Keywords AI improves your large language model (LLM) application uptime and cost saving without sacrificing the quality of the model. We connect your request to the best model for the task and help you keep track of its performance, usage, and cost. We experienced challenges in scaling LLM applications cost-effectively, so we built Keywords AI to help you overcome them. */}
Keywords AI makes it easy for developers to build LLM applications. With 2 lines of code, developers get a complete DevOps platform that speeds up deploying & monitoring AI apps.
