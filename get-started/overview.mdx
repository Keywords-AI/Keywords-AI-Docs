## Keywords AI Documentation

Keywords AI improves your large language model (LLM) application uptime and cost saving without sacrificing the quality of the model. We connect your request to the best model for the task and help you keep track of its performance, usage, and cost. We experienced challenges in scaling LLM applications cost-effectively, so we built Keywords AI to help you overcome them.
