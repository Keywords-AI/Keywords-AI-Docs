title: Webhooks

The Keywords AI platform provides a webhook system that allows you to receive notifications when certain events occur. 

For example, when Keywords AI logs a new request, your webhook and point can receive this notification as an API call from Keywords AI.

## Example for using Webhooks
1. Define a webhook endpoint in your application.

This endpoint sends an email to the admin when a webhook event is received.
```Python Django

class TestWebhook(APIView):
    authentication_classes = []
    permission_classes = [AllowAny]

    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        data = request.data
        send_mail(
            subject=f'Test Webhook Received',
            message=f"Webhook data: {data}",
            from_email=settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL,
            recipient_list=[settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL],
        )
        return Response({"message": "Webhook received."}, status=200)
```

2. Create a new webhook in the Keywords AI platform.
    1. Go to the [Webhooks page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/api/webhooks) in the Keywords AI platform.
    2. Click on the "Create Webhook" button, a modal will appear.

    3. Define the webhook URL, name and select the events (new request is logged) you want to receive notifications for.
    4. Click on the "Create" button.

3. Make an API call to [API endpoint](/get-started/quick-start)

4. Receive the email.
