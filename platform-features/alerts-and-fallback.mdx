title: Alerts and Fallback
---

By default, the safety net will be on and catch any errors that fail. You can also turn off the safety net and handle the errors yourself, this is generally NOT recommended.

You can turn on/off the safety net [here](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/api/alerts-&-fallback).

## Exceptions for Triggering Fallbacks
- You turned off the safety net
- You uploaded some invalid [customer_credentials](/api-endpoints/proxy-endpoints/text-generation/request-params#:~:text=customer_credentials)

In the above cases, we will directly forward the error messages from our upstream providers to you.
