You can set the budget to the specific user by calling the [User Update endpoint](/api-endpoints/async-endpoints/user-update-endpoint) or the [User Creation endpoint](/api-endpoints/async-endpoints/user-creation-endpoint) for the new users.

### Budget period
- Set the budget period. If not provided, the `period_start` will be set to the current date and the `period_end` will be set based on the `period_start` + `budget_duration`.
```json
{
    "period_start": "2024-03-09",
    "period_end": "2024-04-09"
}
```

-  You could also set `budget_duration` to the user. In this case, you don't need to set the `period_start` and `period_end`, where `period_start` will be set to the current date and the `period_end` will be set based on the `period_start` + `budget_duration`.
```json
{
    "budget_duration": "monthly" // "yearly", "monthly", "weekly", "daily
}
```
### Budget limit
- Set the `period_budget` to the user. This will set the limit on the user's budget for the period.
```json
{
    "period_budget": 30 //$30
}
```
