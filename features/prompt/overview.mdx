## What is Prompts?
Prompt engineering is an emerging discipline focused on designing and optimizing inputs for language models (LMs) to maximize their effectiveness across various applications. It is a crucial skill for understanding and leveraging the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs).




## Why prompts engineering?
- You can create, version, share, and deploy prompt templates easily.
- You can test and compare different prompt versions.
- You can monitor prompt performance.

## Quick start

{/* Prompt engineering is an emerging discipline focused on designing and optimizing inputs for language models (LMs) to maximize their effectiveness across various applications. It is a crucial skill for understanding and leveraging the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs).


This field serves multiple stakeholders:

- Researchers use it to enhance LLMs' performance in complex tasks, including question answering and arithmetic reasoning

- Developers employ it to create robust interfaces between LLMs and other tools

- Safety engineers utilize it to improve LLM security and reliability



Beyond prompt creation, prompt engineering encompasses:

- Techniques for effective LLM interaction

- Methods for integrating domain knowledge

- Strategies for combining LLMs with external tools

- Skills for optimizing model outputs */}
