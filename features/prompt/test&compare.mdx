You can test and compare prompts for different models on the _[playground page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/playground)_.

{/* ## Components of the Playground */}
{/* ### System Prompt
The system prompt is the initial prompt that is given to the model. It is the first input that the model receives. The system prompt can be used to set the context for the model.

### The Chat Box
The chat box is where the conversation between the user and the model is displayed. The user can input messages and the model will respond.

### Control Panel
The control panel is where the user can select the model to use, adjust the input parameters, and keep track of the session metrics.

#### Model selection:
You can select the model to use from the dropdown menu. The models available are the ones that you have access to.
-  Default is  "gpt-3.5-turbo" (corresponds to response A) and "gpt-4" (corresponds to response B)

-  If one model is set to `None`, the response will be generated by the other model.

## Select models to compare
1. Select the number of models to compare. You can select up to 2 models to compare:
<Frame caption="Left: single model  -> Right: two model mode.">

</Frame>

2. Choose the models you want to compare in the `right sidebar`.


## Copy code with the prompt
Click the `View code` button in the top bar to copy the code with the prompt and paste it into your code editor.

## Save prompts to the library
After you have created a prompt, you can save it to the library for future use. Click the `Save as new prompt` button in the top bar to save the prompt. <br/>
You can check the new prompt on the [Prompts page](/features/prompt/prompt-management).

## Input Parameters:
You can adjust the input parameters to control the behavior of the model. The input parameters available are:
- Temperature: A value between 0 and 1. A higher value will make the model more creative.
- Max Tokens: The maximum number of tokens in the response.
- Frequency Penalty: A value between 0 and 2. A higher value will make the model less repetitive. [See more](/concepts/llm-params)
- Presence Penalty: A value between 0 and 2. A higher value will make the model use more variety of tokens. [See more](/concepts/llm-params)

{/* ### Recent Session Panel
You can see the recent session in the right panel after generating one response and see metrics of the current session:

{/* 3. Adjust the input parameters:
<img src="/images/platform-features/playground/select-params.png" alt="playground"/>
- We select temperature 1 because we want the model to be more creative
- We select max tokens 1482 because we want a full view of a poker game with enough details
- Frequency penalty 0, keep it as default
- Presence penalty 0, keep it as default */}

{/* 4. Let the game begin!

5. If you don't like your hand, you can always regenerate or just delete it (click on the trash icon).

6. Game over, we won! Let's take a look at the results and metrics of the session.
