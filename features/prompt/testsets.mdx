Testsets are a collection of test cases that you can use to evaluate and optimize your LLM outputs. You can import a CSV file and edit it like a Google Sheet. Testsets are useful for running prompts with various dynamic test cases.

## Guide
### Create your test cases in a CSV file.
Create a CSV file with columns matching your prompt variables. Each column header should be a variable name (without the `{{}}` syntax). You can include an additional column for expected outputs.

For example, if your prompt uses variables like `{{first_name}}`, `{{description}}`, `{{job_title}}`, and `{{company_name}}`, your CSV should have columns named `first_name`, `description`, `job_title`, and `company_name`.

### Import the testset
You can import the CSV file and edit it like a Google Sheet. You can add, delete, or edit the test cases in the testset.

### Import testsets to Lab
Compare prompts with different test cases and debug the prompts.

You can use the testset in the [Lab](/features/prompt/lab) to evaluate the prompts with different test cases.

### Import ideal outputs
If you want to include ideal outputs in the testset, you can add a column for the expected output. Name the column `ideal_output`, then the testset will show the ideal output for each test case.
