Testsets are a collection of test cases that you can use to evaluate and optimize your LLM outputs. You can import a CSV file and edit it like a Google Sheet. Testsets are useful for running prompts with various dynamic test cases.

## Guide
### 1. Create your test cases in a CSV file.
Create a CSV file for a prompt with different test cases. In the CSV file, every column is a variable, so you have to name the columns with the variable names. You can also add a column for the expected output. 

For example, if you have a prompt with variables `{{a}}` and `{{b}}`, your CSV file should have columns `a` and `b`.

### 2. Import the testset
You can import the CSV file and edit it like a Google Sheet. You can add, delete, or edit the test cases in the testset.

### 3. Use testsets in Lab
Compare prompts with different test cases and debug the prompts.

You can use the testset in the [Lab](/features/prompt/lab) to evaluate the prompts with different test cases.
