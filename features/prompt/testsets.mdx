Testsets are a collection of test cases that you can use to evaluate and optimize your LLM outputs. You can import a CSV file and edit it like a Google Sheet. Testsets are useful for running prompts with various dynamic test cases.

## Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Create your test cases in a CSV file.">
Create a CSV file for a prompt with different test cases. In the CSV file, every column is a variable, so you have to name the columns with the variable names. You can also add a column for the expected output. 

For example, if you have a prompt with variables `{{a}}` and `{{b}}`, your CSV file should have columns `a` and `b`.
