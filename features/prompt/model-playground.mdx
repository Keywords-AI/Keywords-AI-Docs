Test and iterate on your prompts directly in the Keywords AI LLM playground. You can test your prompts with different models, settings, and parameters to evaluate their performance.

{/* ## Components of the Playground */}
{/* ### System Prompt
The system prompt is the initial prompt that is given to the model. It is the first input that the model receives. The system prompt can be used to set the context for the model.

### The Chat Box
The chat box is where the conversation between the user and the model is displayed. The user can input messages and the model will respond.

### Control Panel
The control panel is where the user can select the model to use, adjust the input parameters, and keep track of the session metrics.

#### Model selection:
You can select the model to use from the dropdown menu. The models available are the ones that you have access to.
-  Default is  "gpt-3.5-turbo" (corresponds to response A) and "gpt-4" (corresponds to response B)

-  If one model is set to `None`, the response will be generated by the other model.

## Improve existing prompts
You can use the playground to test and iterate on prompts in your library.

### Bringing existing prompts to the playground
When you finish writing a prompt in the prompt editor, you can bring it to the playground to test and iterate on it. First, enter the values for each variable in the prompt, then click the `Playground` button in the top bar.

### Saving the optimized prompt
After you have tested and iterated on a prompt, you can save it to the library for future use. Click the `Commit` button in the top bar to save the prompt. <br/>
The prompt will be saved to the library, and you can find it on the [Prompts page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/prompts).

## Debugging prompts from logs
You can also debug prompts from your production logs. Find a log containing a prompt that you want to debug, and click the `Open in Playground` button in the top bar.

## Advanced features
We provide the ability to test LLMs with function calling and image support. Here's a guide on how to use these features.

### Function calling
In the playground, click the `Add tool` button to enter your function in the code editor.

{/* ### Recent Session Panel
You can see the recent session in the right panel after generating one response and see metrics of the current session:

{/* 3. Adjust the input parameters:

- We select temperature 1 because we want the model to be more creative
- We select max tokens 1482 because we want a full view of a poker game with enough details
- Frequency penalty 0, keep it as default
- Presence penalty 0, keep it as default */}

{/* 4. Let the game begin!

5. If you don't like your hand, you can always regenerate or just delete it (click on the trash icon).

6. Game over, we won! Let's take a look at the results and metrics of the session.
