You can test and compare prompts for different models on the _[playground page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/playground)_.

{/* ## Components of the Playground */}
{/* ### System Prompt
The system prompt is the initial prompt that is given to the model. It is the first input that the model receives. The system prompt can be used to set the context for the model.

### The Chat Box
The chat box is where the conversation between the user and the model is displayed. The user can input messages and the model will respond.

### Control Panel
The control panel is where the user can select the model to use, adjust the input parameters, and keep track of the session metrics.

#### Model selection:
You can select the model to use from the dropdown menu. The models available are the ones that you have access to.
-  Default is  "gpt-3.5-turbo" (corresponds to response A) and "gpt-4" (corresponds to response B)

-  If one model is set to `None`, the response will be generated by the other model.

## Open logs in playground
 You can open the logs in the playground by clicking the `Open in Playground` button on the logs page, which is helpful to test and compare the responses of the models.

## A/B test LLM models
You can compare the responses of two models side by side. Click the `Compare` button in the top bar to compare the responses of the two models.

## Test models with different settings
You could adjust the settings of the model to see how it affects the response. 
Check out to [OpenAI params page](api-endpoints/proxy-endpoints/chat-completions) for more information about these parameters.

`Variants`: You can set variants from 1 - 50 to test different responses from the model. This is helpful to see how consistent the model is.

## Function calling and image
We provide you with the ability to test the LLMs with function calling and image. You can click on the `Add tool` button or `link` icon to add a function or image.

## 1 click to integrate models
Click the `View code` button in the top bar to copy the code with the prompt and paste it into your code editor.

## Save prompts to the library
After you have created a prompt, you can save it to the library for future use. Click the `Save as new prompt` button in the top bar to save the prompt. <br/>
You can check the new prompt on the [Prompts page](/features/prompt/prompt-management).

{/* ### Recent Session Panel
You can see the recent session in the right panel after generating one response and see metrics of the current session:

{/* 3. Adjust the input parameters:
<img src="/images/platform-features/playground/select-params.png" alt="playground"/>
- We select temperature 1 because we want the model to be more creative
- We select max tokens 1482 because we want a full view of a poker game with enough details
- Frequency penalty 0, keep it as default
- Presence penalty 0, keep it as default */}

{/* 4. Let the game begin!

5. If you don't like your hand, you can always regenerate or just delete it (click on the trash icon).

6. Game over, we won! Let's take a look at the results and metrics of the session.
