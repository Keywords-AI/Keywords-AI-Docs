Keywords AI provides you with the ability to monitor your prompts in production and get detailed metrics.

Here's how you can monitor a prompt:

## 1. Pass the prompt ID to the API
You need to pass the prompt ID to the API. Whether you are using the LLM proxy or the Async logging, you can both monitor the prompt by passing the prompt ID in the payload. Once you [create a prompt](/features/prompt/create-a-prompt), you can find the prompt ID in the Overview panel on the [Prompts page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/prompts).

## 2. Get the metrics
We'll help you calculate the metrics like number of tokens, number of requests, number of errors, and more. You will find the dashboard for each prompt on the [Prompts page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/prompts).
