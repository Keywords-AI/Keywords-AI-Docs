## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is an emerging discipline focused on designing and optimizing inputs for language models (LMs) to maximize their effectiveness across various applications. It is a crucial skill for understanding and leveraging the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs).


This field serves multiple stakeholders:

- Researchers use it to enhance LLMs' performance in complex tasks, including question answering and arithmetic reasoning

- Developers employ it to create robust interfaces between LLMs and other tools

- Safety engineers utilize it to improve LLM security and reliability



Beyond prompt creation, prompt engineering encompasses:

- Techniques for effective LLM interaction

- Methods for integrating domain knowledge

- Strategies for combining LLMs with external tools

- Skills for optimizing model outputs
