With our Prompts management feature, you could easily iterate and version your prompts as a team, deploy them to your codebase with 1 line of code, and share them with your team, test them in the Playground, and more.

Check out the [Prompts page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/prompts) to see the prompts you have created and deployed.




## How to create a prompt

<img width="400" src="/images/platform-features/prompts/prompts.png" alt="playground"/>

1. **Create a new prompt**: Click the `+ New prompt` button to create a new prompt. Give it a name and a description.
{/* <img src="/images/platform-features/prompts/new-prompt.png" alt="prompts"/> */}
2. **Write your template**: First choose a model you want to test, then write the system prompt and user prompt.
3. **Check output in the Playground**: Click the `Playground` button to view the output of your prompt across different models.

4. **Input variables**: Insert dynamic input variables into your prompt template using curly brackets `{{your variables}}`.
5. **Deploy your version to the team**: Click the `Deploy version` button to deploy your prompt to the team. You can check the deployed version on the **left sidebar**.
6. **Copy the code into your codebase** Click the `View code` button to copy the prompt code into your codebase or copy the prompt ID and paste it into your codebase.
<Check>After you have added your prompt ID to your codebase, you can now iterate your prompts and versions in the Prompts page without changing your codebase.</Check>
## Example
```json
{
  "prompt"{
     "prompt_id": "prompt_id", //paste this from the prompt management page
     "variables": {
       "variable_name": "variable_value"
     },
     "version": 1 //specify which version of the prompt you want to use
     // "echo": true //optional parameter
  }
}
```
### Optional parameter
<ParamField path="echo" type="boolean" default={true}>
  with echo on, the response body will have an extra field
```json
  "prompt_message" [an array of messages]
```
</ParamField>
