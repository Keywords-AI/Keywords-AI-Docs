With our Prompts management feature, you can easily iterate and version your prompts as a team, deploy them to your codebase with one line of code, share them with your team, test them in the Playground, and more.

Check out the [Prompts page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/prompts) to see the prompts you have created and deployed.

<Step title="Deploy your prompt to the production" >
After you have tested your prompt and are satisfied with the outputs, you can commit it and then deploy it to your codebase with one line of code.

       "variable_name": "variable_value"
     },
     "version": 1 //specify which version of the prompt you want to use
