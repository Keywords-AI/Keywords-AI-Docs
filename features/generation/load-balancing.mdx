Load balancing is a feature that allows you to balance the request load across different models or deployments. You could specify weights for each model/deployment based on their rate limit and your preference.

_See all supported params [here](/api-endpoints/integration/chat-completions)._

## Load balancing between models
You could specify the load balancing weights for different models. This is useful when you want to balance the load between different models from different providers. 


<Steps>
    <Step title="Go to the Load balancing page">
        Go to the [Load balancing page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/api/load-balance) and click on ` Create load balancing group`
        <img src="/images/api-features/lb_group.jpg" alt="Load balancing group"/>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add models">
        Click `Add model` to add models and specify the weight for each model and add your own credentials.
    </Step>
        <Step title="Copy group ID to your codebase">
        After you have added the models, copy the group ID (**the blue text**) to your codebase and use it in your requests.

<Note> **The `model` parameter will overwrite the `load_balance_group`!**  </Note>
```json
{
// you don't need to specify the model parameter, otherwise, the model parameter will overwrite the load balance group
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hi, how are you?"
        }
    ],
    "load_balance_group": {
        "group_id":"THE_GROUP_ID" // from Load balancing page
    }
}
```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add load balancing group in code (Optional)">
    You could also add the load balancing group in your codebase directly. 

    The `models` field will overwrite the `load_balance_group` you specified in the UI.
    <Accordion title="Example code">
```json
{
  "load_balance_group": {
      "group_id":"THE_GROUP_ID", // from Load balancing page
      "models": [
        {
          "model": "azure/gpt-35-turbo",
          "weight": 1
        },
        {
          "model": "azure/gpt-4",
          "credentials": { // add your own credentials if you want to use your own Azure credentials or custom model name
              "api_base": "Your own Azure api_base",
              "api_version": "Your own Azure api_version",
              "api_key": "Your own Azure api_key"
          },
          "weight": 1
        } 
      ]
  }
}
```
    </Accordion>
    </Step>
</Steps>



You could also set up fallback models to avoid errors. It will fall back to the list of models you specified in the `fallback` field once have any outages. Check out the [Fallbacks](/features/generation/fallbacks) section for more information.




## Load balancing between deployments
You could go to the platform and add multiple deployments for the same provider. You could specify the load balancing weights for each deployment, which could be helpful when you want to enhance rate limits for a single provider.

## How load balancing works
Under the hood, here is the pseudo-code of how the load balancing works:

```python
# Received model in the request
model_name = "requested_model_from_request"
# Load the model's param and its respective providers
model: dict = keywords_ai_model_data[model_name] # A slice from our data

fallback_models = model["load_balancing_fallbacks"]

balancing_between = []
for fallback in fallback_models:
    fallback_param = pack_fallback_list_object(fallback)
    """
    A fallback_param looks something like this:
    {
        "model_name": "model_that_needs_a_fallback",
        "fallback_name": "model_to_fallback_to",
        "rate_limit": 1000,
        "latency": This is live data from the provider based on daily ping
    }
    """
    balancing_between.append(fallback_param)

# ...Omit code until generation...
# Randomly pick a provider based on the latency and rate_limit distribution
model = pick_model_to_use(balancing_between)
keywords_generation(module, **other_kwargs)

```


distribution = [rate_limit_1, rate_limit_2, rate_limit_3] / sum_of_rate_limits <br/>
weights = add_latency_weight_to_distribution(distribution, [latency_1, latency_2, latency_3])<br/>
model = random.choices(balancing_between, weights=weights) */}


## Deprecated params
The `loadbalance_models` parameter is deprecated. You should use the `load_balance_group` parameter instead.
