Keywords AI allows you to manage your API keys when you create a new key. Our key management provides you a simple way to manage your spending and time period for your API keys.
## Setting API key
You could set spending limits, expiration dates, and rate limits for your API keys. This will help you to manage your spending and avoid any unexpected charges.
