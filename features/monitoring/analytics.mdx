title: Overview
description: Keywords AI provides complete observability for your LLM applications. With this guide, you can learn how to use Keywords AI observability features to monitor and improve LLM outputs.
---

## Prerequisites
To use Keywords AI observability features, you should have integrated our [LLM proxy](/get-started/llm-inference.mdx) or [async logging API](/get-started/async-logging.mdx) into your codebase. After that, you can use Keywords AI to get complete observability for your apps.

## Usage dashboard
Keywords AI provides a comprehensive dashboard to monitor your LLM usage and spending. Once you have integrated our [LLM proxy](/get-started/llm-inference.mdx) or [async logging API](/get-started/async-logging.mdx) into your application, you can see the usage and spending of your LLM applications.

{/* ## Example
Let's take a look at an example of seeing the latency of the API requests over the month with a breakdown by models

1. Select the `Latency` metric

Let's see the result:

Looks pretty good!

4. You can open the side panel to see the summary of the breakdown by clicking the icon on the right of the control bar:
