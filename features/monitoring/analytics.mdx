Keywords AI's [dashboard page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/dashboard) assists developers in identifying and fixing code or LLM-related issues.

You can see aggregated metrics such as the number of requests over time, average generation time, time to first token (TTFT), total cost, average number of tokens, and user activity.

## Graphs

### LLM metrics
LLM graphs aggregate your API calls and trace them through time, making it easy to visually keep track of your API usage.

{/* ### Metric Cards
On the top of the dashboard page, you will find these metric cards that give you a quick overview of your API usage.
<img src="/images/platform-features/dashboard/dashboard-summary.png" alt="Dashboard Page" />

Each card shows an aggregation of the metric and a small embedded chart that shows the trend of the metric over time. */}

{/* ### Display Metrics & Breakdown Controls
You can control the displays of the chart in the middle control bar
<img src="/images/platform-features/dashboard/dashboard-filter.png" alt="Dashboard Filter" />

You can choose which chart to display and filter the requests in the graph by metrics.

By default, the chart traces the total aggregation of the selected metric through time. You can also choose the breakdown type to see the distribution of the metric by different aggregations.

### Users

User graphs provide an overview of the user information being sent to Keywords AI.

You can tag each of your API calls with a customer_identifier and we will keep track of the usage of each of your users. See examples here: [User data](/features/monitoring/user-data#example)

### Evaluation

Evaluation graphs provide an overview of the performance of LLM output based on Keywords AI's built-in metrics and users' customized evaluation metrics.

See how to turn on evaluations and create your evaluation metrics here: _[Evaluation](/features/evaluation/overview)_

{/* ## Example
Let's take a look at an example of seeing the latency of the API requests over the month with a breakdown by models

1. Select the `Latency` metric
<img src="/images/platform-features/dashboard/latency.png" alt="Dashboard Select Latency" />
2. Select the display timeline type to `Month`.
<img src="/images/platform-features/dashboard/month-timeline.png" alt="Dashboard Select Latency" />
3. Select the breakdown type to `Model`.
<img src="/images/platform-features/dashboard/breakdown-model.png" alt="Dashboard Select Latency" />

Let's see the result:

Looks pretty good!

4. You can open the side panel to see the summary of the breakdown by clicking the icon on the right of the control bar:

Great! You can try different combinations of metrics and breakdown types to learn more about your API usage. */}
