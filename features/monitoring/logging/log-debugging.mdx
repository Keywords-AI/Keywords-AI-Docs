## Overview
So many AI teams spend a lot of time debugging LLM failures. The failure might due to the model version, the prompt, the data, the configuration, etc. It's very hard to find the root cause. In Logs, you can easily identify the root cause of the failure and fix it.

## You will love it when you want to:
- Debug bad LLM outputs.
- Find the root cause of the failure.
- Save time by debugging logs you need.

## Quick start

### Error message
When you get an error from the log, you can click the error log to see the error message in the side panel. Then, you can follow the error message to fix the issue.

### Improve the prompt
Sometimes, the LLM outputs are not what you want. You can click the log to see the prompt and the completion. Then, you can click `Open in Playground` to improve the prompt and check the new output.
