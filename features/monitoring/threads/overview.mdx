## What is Threads?
Threads are conversation groupings for chatlogs. You can easily track multi-turn conversations by passing in a Thread ID when logging.

## You will love it when you want to:
- Track multi-turn conversations.
- Check the whole conversation history instead of a single log.

## Quick start

In your API payload, pass `thread_identifier` to group the chatlogs into a thread. Every log with the same `thread_identifier` will be grouped into the same thread.

```python Python {4}
payload = {
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a long story"}],
    "thread_identifier": "thread_id"
}
```
