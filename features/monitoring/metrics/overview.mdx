## What are LLM usage metrics?
LLM usage metrics are the metrics that you can use to monitor the usage of your LLM applications. You can view metrics like: `Total requests`, `Token usage`, `Errors`, `Latency`, `Cost`, and break down by `Model`, `User`, `API key`, and `Prompt`. 

We built a comprehensive usage dashboard to help you understand your LLM usage and optimize AI performance.
