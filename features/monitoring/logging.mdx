Title: Requests Log
---

{/* The requests log page is a table view that shows all the API calls that have been made to the Keywords AI. This is useful for debugging and monitoring the API usage. */}
Keywords AI automatically logs all LLM requests when using Keywords AI's API.

By clicking on an entry, a side panel opens up, revealing a detailed view of the request and response objects. You can see Metadata, Request/Response content, and Evaluation results in it.
