You could pass all the logs in the same conversation with the same `thread_identifier`. This fits use cases of conversational AI better than Logs as the chatlogs will be grouped together as an entire conversation thread, with only the most recent request on display for each conversation.

You will see logs with the same `thread_identifier` in the logs page like this:
<img width="300" src="/images/requests-log/thread.png" />

## Example
```json
{
    //...other_params,
    "thread_identifier": "test_thread"
}
```
