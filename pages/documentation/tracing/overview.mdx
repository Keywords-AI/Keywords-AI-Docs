## What is traces?
Traces are a chained collection of workflows and tasks. You can use tree views and waterfalls to better track dependencies and latency.

## You will love it when you want to:
- Track the latency of each step in a workflow.
- Debug an error in an agent workflow.
- See the dependencies between workflows and tasks.
