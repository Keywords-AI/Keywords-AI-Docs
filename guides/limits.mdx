## Rate Limits

### What is 'Rate Limit'

Rate limiting is the process of controlling the rate at which a user can make requests to the API, typically implemented to preserve the integrity and availability of the service, preventing any individual user or system from overloading it.

### Why Rate Limits Exist

**Ensure Fair Usage**: Prevents any single user or system from monopolizing the server resources, ensuring equitable access for all users.
**Maintain Quality of Service**: Helps to assure that the service remains available and responsive to all users by preventing accidental or intentional service overloads.  
**Security**: Acts as a rudimentary shield against certain types of attacks, such as DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service).

### Keywords AI’s Rate Limit

Currently, Keywords AI’s rate limit is set at **100 requests per minute or 40000 tokens per minute**, whichever reached first.
