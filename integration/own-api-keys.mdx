title: "Use your own API keys"
---

If you want to use your own API keys from other providers, you can 
1. pass in a dictionary of your customerâ€™s credentials and deployment variables for supported providers and use their credits.* <br/>
<sub>*Azure has some difference in code, checkout the [Azure](/integration/providers/azure) page for more details.</sub>

```json
{
"customer_credentials": {
  "openai": {
    "api_key": "sk-DEacrWTDndFYhdcLYKF6T3BlbkdfghuyTj4sYL2v1EDhg3iz5",
  },
  "provider_id": { // eg. azure_openai, anthropic
    "some_provider_var_names": "some_provider_var_values"
  }
}
}
```

2. Add your own API keys on Keywords AI. Go to Settings -> API Keys -> Turn on `Bring your own models`
