title: "Use your own API keys"
---

If you want to use your own API keys from other providers, you can 
- pass in your customerâ€™s credentials and deployment variables for supported providers and use their credits.*  Check out `customer_credentials` [here](/api-endpoints/proxy-endpoints/chat-completions) <br/>
<sub>*Azure has some differences in code, check out the [Azure](/integration/providers/azure) page for more details.</sub>

```json
{
  "customer_credentials": {
    "openai": {
      "api_key": "sk-DEacrWTDndFYhdcLYKF6T3BlbkdfghuyTj4sYL2v1EDhg3iz5",
    },
    "provider_id": { // eg. azure_openai, anthropic
      "some_provider_var_names": "some_provider_var_values" //eg. api_key
    }
  }
}
```

- Add your own API keys on Keywords AI. Go to Settings -> API Keys -> Turn on `Bring your own models`
