## Add it in code
Add `customer_credentials` parameter in your [request body](/api-endpoints/proxy-endpoints/chat-completions) to use your own Vertex AI credits.

{/* To find the parameters needed, you can follow these steps:

```json
{
  // Rest of the request body
  "customer_credentials": {
    "google_vertex_ai": {
      "vertex_ai_project": "your-project",
      "vertex_ai_location": "your-location",
      "vertex_ai_credentials": credentials // a JSON object, you could also pass an entire JSON object here
    }
  }
}
```
## Requirements
1. Ensure your **deployment name** matches those listed on our [Models page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/models).
2. Confirm that your models are available in the region specified by your credentials.
<Warning>Credentials validation is not supported. Failure to comply with these requirements will result in errors!</Warning>

### How to get your Vertex AI credentials
1. Run `gcloud init` to initialize the gcloud CLI.
2. Run `gcloud info` to get the path of your credential. You will see a line like <br/>`User Config Directory: [/home/USERNAME/.config/gcloud]`
3. You will find a file named `application_default_credentials.json` in the path you got from the previous step. This file contains your credentials.
4. Load this json file into the `vertex_ai_credentials` field in the request body.

For example:

```python
with open("./credentials/google/application_default_credentials.json", "r") as f:
    credentials = json.load(f)
```
