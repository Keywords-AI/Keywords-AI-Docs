<Step title="(Optional) Choose models you want to use credits">
You can choose the models you want to use your credits with. Just simply type the model ID from the [Models page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/models) and copy the model id and paste it in the Available models. Press `Enter` to add the model. 

**Leave it empty to apply your credentials for all AWS Bedrock models.**

</Step>
</Steps>

## Add it in code
Add `customer_credentials` parameter in your [request body](/api-endpoints/integration/chat-completions) to use your own AWS Bedrock credits.

```json
{
  // Rest of the request body
  "customer_credentials": {
    "bedrock": {
      "aws_access_key_id": "aws_access_key_id",
      "aws_secret_access_key": "aws_secret_access_key",
      "aws_region_name": "aws_region_name",
    }
  }
}
```

## Override credentials for a particular model. (Optional)
One-off credential overrides. Instead of using what is uploaded for each provider, this targets credentials for individual models.
```json
{
  // Rest of the request body
  "customer_credentials": {
    "bedrock": {
      "aws_access_key_id": "aws_access_key_id",
      "aws_secret_access_key": "aws_secret_access_key",
      "aws_region_name": "aws_region_name",
    }
  },
  "credential_override": {
    "bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0":{ // override for a specific model.
      "aws_access_key_id": "another_aws_access_key_id",
      "aws_secret_access_key": "another_aws_secret_access_key",
      "aws_region_name": "another_aws_region_name",
    }
  }
}
```

## Requirements
1. Ensure your **deployment name** matches those listed on our [Models page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/models).
2. Confirm that your models are available in the region specified by your credentials.
<Warning>Credentials validation is not supported. Failure to comply with these requirements will result in errors!</Warning>

### How to get your AWS Bedrock credentials
1. Go to `https://aws.amazon.com/` and click on `Sign In to the Console`.
2. Choose your region and click on `Security credentials` in the top right corner.
3. Click on `Access keys` and then `Create New Access Key`.
4. You will see your `Access key ID` and `Secret access key`. Copy these values and use them in the `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` fields in the request body.
5. You can find your `aws_region_name` in the URL of the AWS console. For example, if the URL is `https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/`, then the `aws_region_name` is `us-west-2`.
