<Note> This section is for **Keywords AI LLM gateway** users.</Note>

Use Keywords AI Gateway to call OpenAI models while keeping unified observability (logs, cost, latency, and reliability metrics) in Keywords AI.

## Prerequisites
- A **Keywords AI API key**
- An **OpenAI API key** (BYOK)

## Configuration
There are 2 ways to add your OpenAI credentials to your requests:
### Via UI (Global)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Providers">
    Go to the [Providers page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/api/providers). This page allows you to manage credentials for over 20+ supported providers.
    <Frame>
      <img src="https://keywordsai-static.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/settings/providers.jpg" alt="Keywords AI Providers Page"/>
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your OpenAI API Key">
    Select OpenAI and paste your API key.
    <img width="600" src="https://keywordsai-static.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Integrations/api_keys/openai_2.png" alt="Add OpenAI Credentials"/>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Load Balancing (Optional)">
    You can add multiple OpenAI API keys for redundancy. Use the `Load balancing weight` field to determine how traffic is distributed between keys.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Via code (Per-Request)
You can pass credentials dynamically in the request body. This is useful if you need to use your users' own API keys (BYOK).

Add the `customer_credentials` parameter to your [Gateway request](/api-endpoints/develop/gateway/chat-completions):

```json
{
  // Rest of the request body
  "customer_credentials": {
    "openai": {
      "api_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
    }
  }
}
```

## Log OpenAI requests

If you are not using the Gateway to proxy requests, you can still log your OpenAI requests to Keywords AI asynchronously. This allows you to track cost, latency, and performance metrics for external calls.

```python OpenAI Python SDK
import requests

url = "https://api.keywordsai.co/api/request-logs/create/"
payload = {
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "prompt_messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hello, how are you?"
        }
    ],
    "completion_message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking!"
    },
    "cost": 0.0015,
    "generation_time": 2.3,
    "customer_params": {
        "customer_identifier": "user_123"
    }
}
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_KEYWORDS_AI_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
```
