</Step>
<Step title="Add more OpenAI API keys.">
We support adding multiple OpenAI API keys. You can add as many as you want. In the field of `Load balancing weight`, you can set the weight of the API key. This is used to distribute the load between the API keys.

### Via code
Add `customer_credentials` parameter in your [request body](/api-endpoints/integration/chat-completions) to use your own OpenAI credits.

```json
{
  // Rest of the request body
  "customer_credentials": {
    "openai": {
      "api_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
    }
  }
}
```
