</Steps>

## Add it in code

Add `customer_credentials` parameter in your [request body](/api-endpoints/proxy-endpoints/chat-completions) to use your own Anthropic credits.

```json
{
  // Rest of the request body
  "customer_credentials": {
    "anthropic": {
      "api_key": "your-api-key"
    }
  }
}
```

## Override credentials for a particular model. (Optional)
One-off credential overrides. Instead of using what is uploaded for each provider, this targets credentials for individual models.
```json
{
  // Rest of the request body
  "customer_credentials": {
    "anthropic": {
      "api_key": "your-api-key"
    }
  },
  "credential_override": {
    "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620":{ // override for a specific model.
      "api_key": "another-api-key"
    }
  }
}
```
