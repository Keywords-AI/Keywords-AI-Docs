There are 2 ways to add your Fireworks credentials to your requests:
## Add it from the UI
1. Go to [Credentials page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/api/credentials)

2. Add your Fireworks AI credentials.
<img height="200" width="300"  src="/images/providers/fireworks.png" alt="Dashboard Page"/>

## Add it in code
- Add `customer_credentials` parameter in your [request body](/api-endpoints/proxy-endpoints/chat-completions) to use your own Fireworks credits.

```json
{
  // Rest of the request body
  "customer_credentials": {
    "fireworks": {
      "api_key": "your-api-key"
    }
  }
}
```
