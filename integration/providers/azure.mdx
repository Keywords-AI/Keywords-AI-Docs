There are 2 ways to add your Azure OpenAI credentials to your requests:
## Add it from the UI
1. Go to [Credentials page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/api/credentials)

2. Add your Azure OpenAI credentials.

## Add it in code
<Steps>

<Step title="Map your deployment name"> 
We understand that you may have a custom name for your Azure deployment. Keywords AI is using the model's origin name which may not be able to match your deployment. You can use `model_name_map` to map the default name to your custom name. 

Here's an example: if you want to use `azure/gpt-4o` on Keywords AI with your own Azure credentials and custom deployment name, you should put your custom deployment name in the `model_name_map` object, and we'll use it to make requests to your deployment.
```json
{
    "model": "azure/gpt-4o",
    "model_name_map": {
      "original_model_name": "azure/your_custom_model_name"
      // e.g, "azure/gpt-4o": "azure/{your gpt-4o's deployment name}"
    }
}
```
</Step>

<Step title="Add your own credentials"> 
Add `customer_credentials` parameter in your [request body](/api-endpoints/proxy-endpoints/chat-completions) to use your own Azure OpenAI credits.

<Note>`model_name_map` only works when your credentials is Valid.</Note>
```json
{
  // Rest of the request body
  "customer_credentials": {
    "azure_openai": {
      "api_key": "your-api-key",
      "api_base": "your-api-base-url",
      "api_version": "your-api-version",
    }
  }
}
```
</Step>

<Step title="Override credentials for a particular model. (Optional)">
One-off credential overrides. Instead of using what is uploaded for each provider, this targets credentials for individual models.
```json
{
  // Rest of the request body
  "customer_credentials": {
    "azure_openai": {
      "api_key": "your-api-key",
      "api_base": "your-api-base-url",
      "api_version": "your-api-version",
    }
  },
  "credential_override": {
    "azure/gpt-4o":{ // override for a specific model.
      "api_key": "your-api-key",
      "api_base": "your-api-base-url",
      "api_version": "your-api-version",
    }
  }
}
```

</Step>

</Steps>
## Requirements
1. Ensure your **deployment name** matches those listed on our [Models page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/models).
2. Confirm that your models are available in the region specified by your credentials.
<Warning>Credentials validation is not supported. Failure to comply with these requirements will result in errors!</Warning>
