## Description
The requested resource could not be found in the Keywords API.

This usually happens in two cases:
- You are trying to access a model that is not provided by the Keywords API endpoint.
- None of the models you specified in the request meet some hard requirements such as function call support or image support, and you turned off [safety net](/features/monitoring/alerts-and-fallback). It is recommended to turn on the safety net to avoid this issue.
