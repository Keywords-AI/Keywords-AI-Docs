## Description

This error code indicates that you have reached some Keywords AI API constraints, usually due to [rate limit](/guides/limits#rate-limits)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rate Limit with Keywords AI">
    You have reached the rate limit of what you assigned to the API Key.

    **Possible Solutions**
    - Go to the [API key page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/api/api-keys) and edit the rate limit of the corresponding key you are using.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rate Limit with your Specified Model">
    You have reached the rate limit of the model you demanded in your request body, and you disabled the [safety net]() so Keywords AI is not activating the fallback protection for you.

    **Possible Solutions**
    - In your request body, add more models to route between in the [`models`]() array.
    - Define [`fallback`]() in your request body
    - Go to the [fallback & alerts page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/api/alerts-&-fallback) page and turn on the safety net.
