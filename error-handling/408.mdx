title: "408: Request Timeout"

## Description
The generation is taking too long to complete. This can happen if the upstream provider is slow to respond due to the high traffic at the given moment.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Streaming Timeout">
    When the streaming is taking more than 180 seconds to complete, we will record this in our logs, but we will not cut off your streaming if it is still generating (despite being slow). You can later review this error in the [request logs]().
```json
{"detail": "Streaming Timeout: Unusually long generation time (>180s), this is likely an error from our upstream provider {get_provider(calling_model_name)} for model: {calling_model_name}"}
```
