## Error Message

Error handling is important for application maintianence. Keywords AI API returns all error messages with the standard structure.

```json
{ "detail": "Error Message" }
```

You can take a look at the example below to see how to catch and see the status of the error if the API throws one.

```JavaScript JavaScript
// An example API call
fetch('https://api.keywordsai.co/api/generate/', {
method: 'POST',
headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Api-Key {YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN}',
},
body: ...some body...
})
.then(async (response) => {
if (!response.ok){
	console.log(reponse.status, await response.json());
}
})
```

If an error occurred, the code above will print the following

```json
400 {"detail": ...some error message...}
```
