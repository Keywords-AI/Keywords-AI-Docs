## How does user analytics work?
On Keywords AI, we built a [Users page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/users) to help you understand your users and their behavior on your LLM applications. With our user analytics feature, you can;
- Track user LLM usage
- Set user budget
- Filter logs by user identifier

You can monitor individual users' activity in your AI products. Get insights into their usage patterns, preferences, and behavior, and take actions to improve the user experience.

## Enable user analytics in the code
You can pass a `customer_params` to the request to track the user's behavior on your LLM applications.


## See user data on the platform
After you send the user's data to Keywords AI, there are 3 places you can see the user's data on the platform.
### 1. [Users page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/users)
You will see each user's detail information and their LLM usage on the Users page and the side panel.

### 2. [Dashboard page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/dashboard)
There are several charts on the Dashboard page to help you understand your users' behavior, including;
- Top users
- Daily active users count
- LLM cost by user

### 3. [Logs page](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/requests)
For each LLM log, you can see the corresponding user's data in the side panel. You can also filter logs by choosing a User Identifier.
