## What is an online evals automation? 
Online evals automatically runs evaluators on your production logs in real-time based on conditions and sampling rules.

## How to set up an online evals automation?

### 1. Create a condition

A **condition** defines the filtering rules that determine which production logs will be evaluated—only logs that match the condition proceed to the sampling and evals stages.  
Go to [Conditions](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/api/conditions).

You can choose one of the following **condition types**:
- **Single log** – triggers when a specific log matches the rule.
- **Aggregation** – triggers based on aggregated metrics over time.

We will choose **Single log** for **Online evals**.  
Following is a simple condition that triggers everytime a log with status code 500 is logged.

### 2. Create an automation

Once your condition and [evaluator](https://docs.keywordsai.co/documentation/products/evaluation/llm-evals/llm-evaluator) are ready, navigate to [Automations](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/monitors) and create a new **automation**.

In the creation form:
1. Select **Online evals** as the type.
2. Select the **condition** you want to track.  
3. Choose the **evaluator** you want to run through.  
4. Set the **Sampling rate** (range from 0 to 1).

After saving, your online evals will appear in the [Automations](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/monitors) list.  
When the defined condition is met, sampling will be done and run through evaluators.
