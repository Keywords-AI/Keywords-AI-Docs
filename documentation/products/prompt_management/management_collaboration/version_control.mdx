## What is version control

Version control is a system that allows you to track changes to your prompts. It's a way to manage and collaborate on your prompts with your team.
## Why version control
1. Track all changes to your prompts over time
2. Understand who made each change and why
3. Roll back to earlier versions if something breaks
4. Work on prompts with teammates without overwriting each other's work
5. Test new prompt ideas without risking your working versions
6. Keep a history of what worked and what didn't

## Quickstart

### Version history

You can view the version history of a prompt in the Overview panel of Prompts.
