## What is Prompts?

Prompt engineering is an emerging discipline focused on designing and optimizing inputs for language models (LMs) to maximize their effectiveness across various applications. It is a crucial skill for understanding and leveraging the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs).




## Why prompts engineering?

* You can create, version, share, and deploy prompt templates easily.
* You can test and compare different prompt versions.
* You can monitor prompt performance.
