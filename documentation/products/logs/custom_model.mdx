## What is a custom model?
Custom models are models that are not natively supported by Keywords AI. You can add your own model definitions to track costs and usage.

## Why use a custom model?
Custom models allow you to create multiple aliases for the same underlying model. This is particularly useful when configuring fallback systems where you want to use the same model with different priorities or for different purposes. By creating distinct names for the same model, you can track usage separately and call each instance independently.
