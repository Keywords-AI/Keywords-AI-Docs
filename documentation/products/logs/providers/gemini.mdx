```python
import requests

        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Describe the image and suggest improvements"
        }
    ],
    "completion_message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The image shows a modern office space with clean lines..."
    },
    "cost": 0.0006,
