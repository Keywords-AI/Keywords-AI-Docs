## Log Perplexity requests

Monitor your Perplexity API calls by logging requests and responses asynchronously. Track metrics like cost, duration, and performance for Perplexity's search-augmented models.

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.keywordsai.co/api/request-logs/create/"
payload = {

    "prompt_messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What are the latest developments in AI?"
        }
    ],
    "completion_message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Recent AI developments include advances in large language models..."
    },
    "cost": 0.0008,
