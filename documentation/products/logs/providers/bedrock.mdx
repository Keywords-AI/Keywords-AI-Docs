## Log AWS Bedrock requests

Monitor your AWS Bedrock API calls by logging requests and responses asynchronously. Track metrics like cost, duration, and performance for Bedrock's foundation models.

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.keywordsai.co/api/request-logs/create/"
payload = {
    "model": "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0",
    "prompt_messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Generate a product description for an eco-friendly water bottle"
        }
    ],
    "completion_message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Introducing the EcoFlow bottle - a sustainable hydration solution..."
    },
    "cost": 0.0009,
    "generation_time": 3.2,
    "customer_params": {
        "customer_identifier": "user_808"
    }
}
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_KEYWORDS_AI_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
