## Log OpenAI requests

Monitor your OpenAI API calls by logging requests and responses asynchronously. Track metrics like cost, duration, and performance for all your OpenAI models including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and more.

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.keywordsai.co/api/request-logs/create/"
payload = {
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "prompt_messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hello, how are you?"
        }
    ],
    "completion_message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking!"
    },
    "cost": 0.0015,
    "generation_time": 2.3,
    "customer_params": {
        "customer_identifier": "user_123"
    }
}
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_KEYWORDS_AI_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
