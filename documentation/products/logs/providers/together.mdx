## Log Together AI requests

Monitor your Together AI API calls by logging requests and responses asynchronously. Track metrics like cost, duration, and performance for Together's diverse model collection.

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.keywordsai.co/api/request-logs/create/"

    "prompt_messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Explain machine learning in simple terms"
        }
    ],
    "completion_message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Machine learning is like teaching computers to learn patterns from data..."
    },
