## Log Groq requests

Monitor your Groq API calls by logging requests and responses asynchronously. Track metrics like cost, duration, and performance for Groq's high-speed inference models.

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.keywordsai.co/api/request-logs/create/"
payload = {
    "model": "llama3-8b-8192",
    "prompt_messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Write a short poem about AI"
        }
    ],
    "completion_message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "In circuits bright and data streams, AI awakens from digital dreams..."
    },
    "cost": 0.0001,
    "generation_time": 0.8,
    "customer_params": {
        "customer_identifier": "user_101"
    }
}
headers = {
