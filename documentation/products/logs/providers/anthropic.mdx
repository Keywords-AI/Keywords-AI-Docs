## Log Anthropic requests

Monitor your Anthropic Claude API calls by logging requests and responses asynchronously. Track metrics like cost, duration, and performance for all Claude models including Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, and more.

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.keywordsai.co/api/request-logs/create/"
payload = {
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
    "prompt_messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What's the weather like today?"
        }
    ],
    "completion_message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I don't have access to real-time weather data, but I can help you find weather information."
    },
    "cost": 0.00042,
    "generation_time": 1.8,
    "customer_params": {
        "customer_identifier": "user_456"

}
headers = {
