## What are views?

**Views** are saved filter configurations. When you apply filters on [Logs](/documentation/products/logs/quickstart), [Traces](/documentation/products/traces/quickstart), [Users](/documentation/products/users/customer-identifier), [Prompts](/documentation/products/prompt_management/quickstart), or elsewhere in Keywords AI—for example, by `status`, `model`, `user`, `timestamp`, or [custom properties](/documentation/products/logs/configuration/custom_properties)—you can save that filter setup as a **view**. Views let you reuse the same filters with one click instead of reconfiguring them each time.

## Where you create filters

You can set up filters in **Logs**, **Traces**, **Users**, **Prompts**, and more:

- **Logs** — Filter by status, model, user, timestamp, custom properties, and more. Use the **Filter** button on the [Logs](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/logs) page.
- **Traces** — Filter traces by workflow, metadata, customer identifier, and other fields on the [Traces](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/traces) page.
- **Users** — Filter users by identifier, usage, and related fields.
- **Prompts** — Filter prompts by name, model, and other attributes.
- **And more** — Views work across filtered surfaces throughout Keywords AI.

Build the filter combination you care about (e.g. “production errors” or “high-cost requests”), then save it as a view.

## Use and manage views

- **Apply a view** — Select a saved view from the views list to instantly apply its filters.
- **Share a filter view** — Share a view with your team so everyone sees the same filtered data. See [Sharing](/documentation/products/logs/sharing#share-a-filter-view) for how to share a filter view.
- **Manage views** — Rename or remove views from the views management UI when they’re no longer needed.

## Resources

- [Filters API Reference](/api-endpoints/reference/filters_api_reference) — Filter logs, traces, users, prompts, and more programmatically; filters support operators like `gt`, `gte`, `contains`, `in`, and more.
- [Sharing](/documentation/products/logs/sharing#share-a-filter-view) — Share filter views with your team.
