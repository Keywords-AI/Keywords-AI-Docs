description: "How to enable thinking mode for supported models"
---

Thinking mode allows supported models to show their reasoning process before providing the final answer. This feature is currently available for select models like Claude Sonnet 4.

## Basic Usage

To enable thinking mode, add the `thinking` parameter to your request:

```python
payload = {
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "max_tokens": 16000,
    "thinking": {
        "type": "enabled",
        "budget_tokens": 10000
    },
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Are there an infinite number of prime numbers such that n mod 4 == 3?"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Parameters

- **type**: Set to `"enabled"` to activate thinking mode
- **budget_tokens**: Maximum number of tokens allocated for the thinking process (optional)

## Supported Models

- choose models that support thinking like `gpt-5`, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`.

## Response Format

When thinking is enabled, the response will include additional fields showing the model's reasoning process. See the [Log Thinking](/documentation/products/logs/log_thinking) documentation for details on the response structure.
