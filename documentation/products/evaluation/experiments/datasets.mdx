This guide will show you how to create a dataset from logs.

## Prerequisites
You should pass variables in the API request, since we use the variables to define columns of the dataset. Learn how to [log variables here](/documentation/products/prompt_management/use_prompt_in_code/use_prompt_in_llms#log-variables-via-api).

## Steps
