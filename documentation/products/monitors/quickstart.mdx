## What is a monitor? 
A monitor is a tool that helps you to monitor your LLM applications. You can set up metrics and alerts to monitor system performance.

## How to create a monitor?

### 1. Create a condition

Start by defining a **condition**, which specifies when an alert should be triggered.  
Go to [Conditions](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/api/conditions).

</Frame>

You can choose one of the following **condition types**:
- **Single log** – triggers when a specific log matches the rule.
- **Aggregation** – triggers based on aggregated metrics over time.

When selecting **Aggregation**, you’ll see the **Time step** option.  
This defines the time interval used for metric aggregation (e.g., every 5 minutes).

Next, configure the **policy** for the condition.  
You can set the **policy type** to either `Alert` or `Warning`, and define it in **JSON** format.

For example, the policy shown above triggers an alert when there are more than 10 HTTP errors (`400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `500`) within a 5-minute window.

### 2. Create a notification

After defining your condition, set up a **notification channel** to receive alerts.  
Go to [Notifications](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/api/notifications).

Currently supported channels:
- **Email**
- **Slack**

### 3. Create a monitor

Once your condition and notification are ready, navigate to [Monitors](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/monitors) and create a new **monitor**.

</Frame>

In the creation form:
1. Select the **condition** you want to track.  
2. Choose the **notification** method.  
3. Set the **severity** level for the alert (e.g., Warning or Critical).

</Frame>

After saving, your monitor will appear in the [Monitors](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/monitors) list.  
When the defined condition is met, alerts will automatically be sent through the selected notification channel.
