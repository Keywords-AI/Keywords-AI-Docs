## What is Respan?

[Respan](https://respan.ai) is an LLM engineering platform designed to help teams build and deploy reliable AI applications. It unifies observability, evaluations, prompt management, and an LLM gateway into a single platform, giving engineering teams full visibility and control over their AI workflows.

## Key capabilities

1. **LLM Observability** — Trace every LLM call end-to-end. Monitor latency, token usage, costs, and error rates across all your AI workflows.
2. **Evaluations** — Run automated assessments on prompt and model changes to catch quality issues before they reach users.
3. **Prompt Management** — Version, test, and deploy prompts collaboratively without code changes, with rollback and A/B testing support.
4. **Unified LLM Gateway** — Route requests across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other providers through a single interface with built-in load balancing, fallbacks, and rate limiting.
