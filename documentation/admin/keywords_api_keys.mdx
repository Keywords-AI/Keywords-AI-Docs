### What is Markup percentage?
Markup percentage is the percentage of the usage that you want to add to the usage of the API key. This is used to give you a better flexibility in your usage.

## Monitor API keys
You could monitor your API key usage and spending in our [dashboard](/features/monitoring/analytics). This will help you to understand your usage and spending.
