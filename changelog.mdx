<Update label="December 19, 2025">
## New
### Click through from the top prompt graph
The top prompt graph is now clickable - select any prompt to jump straight to its prompt details page. This makes it faster to investigate spikes, compare versions, and debug results without leaving the dashboard.

### YAML and Tree view mode for logs
You can now switch log data between Formatted, JSON, YAML, and Tree views in the side panel. Your selection is saved as a preference and persists across sessions.
