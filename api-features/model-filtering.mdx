title: "Model Filtering"
description: "Filter models that don't meet hard requirements to avoid unnecessary computation"
---

Keywords AI has a comprehensive routing-failover system. To ensure high efficiency, we can drop the models that don't meet the hard requirements and fail before performing any computation.

```python
models_to_route_between = [mode_1, model_2, model_3] # Users uploaded list from request

# Load the models into compatible_models_format
keywords_compatible_models_format = {k: v for k, v in model_dictionary.items() if k in models_to_route_between}

def filter_by_hard_requirements(scores, token_count, is_vision, kwargs):
    """
    Hard requirements:
    1. The model must support the context window size
    2. Does the model support vision?
    3. Does the model support the function call?
    """
    processed_scores = scores.copy()
    function_call = "tools" in kwargs or "tool_choice" in kwargs

    filtered_models = {}
    
    for key, value in scores.items():
        if model_dictionary[key]["max_context_window"] < token_count:
            processed_scores.pop(key)
            filtered_models[key] = "Filtered by context window size, consider reducing input tokens."
            continue
        if is_vision and not bool(model_dictionary[key]["image_support"]):
            processed_scores.pop(key)
            filtered_models[key] = "Filtered by vision support, consider changing the 'content' field to text in each message"
            continue
            
        if function_call and not bool(model_dictionary[key]["function_call"]):
            processed_scores.pop(key)
            filtered_models[key] = "Filtered by function call support, consider dropping the 'tools' and 'tool_choice' fields in the request"
            continue
    
    return processed_scores, filtered_models
```

{/* ## Dropping Invalid Params

If you accidentally pass a parameter to a model that is not supported by the model (but passed Keywords AI's validation because it is supported by other models), you can drop the invalid parameters before routing to the model.

```python
for models in keywords_compatible_models_format:
    scores, filtered_models = filter_by_hard_requirements(models, token_count, is_vision, kwargs)
    if len(scores) > 0:
        # Route to the model
    else:
        # Log the filtered models
        print(filtered_models)
``` */}
