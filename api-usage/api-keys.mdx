## What is an API Key?

An API key is a unique identifier used primarily for authentication and access control in software applications. It acts like a passcode that allows your application to communicate with an API (Application Programming Interface). By providing an API key with your requests, the API can verify your identity or the identity of your application and ensure you have the necessary permissions to use the API's services. This is crucial for maintaining security, preventing unauthorized access, and tracking API usage. In essence, an API key is a way to let the API know that the request it's receiving is coming from a trusted source.

## Get an API Key

To procure your API key, navigate to your [API Keys](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/organization/api-keys) page on the platform.


**Careful!!!** API keys are secret and should not be shared publicly. Do not include your API key in your source code or client-side JavaScript. If you believe your API key has been compromised, revoke it and replace it with a new one.

## Use the API Key

If you are using OpenAI SDK:

```python
import openai
openai.base_url = "https://api.keywordsai.co/api/generate/"
openai.api_key = "{YOUR_KEYWORDSD_AI_API_KEY}" # You should replace this with your actual key
...other code...
```

If you are making an HTTP request, include the following in the header

```jsx
... other header params
Authorization: 'Api-Key YOUR_API_KEY'
... other header params
```

## Lost your API Key?

Unfortunately, API key will only show once after you generate it. If you have lost your API key, you will have to regerate your [API Keys](https://platform.keywordsai.co/platform/organization/api-keys) on the platform.
