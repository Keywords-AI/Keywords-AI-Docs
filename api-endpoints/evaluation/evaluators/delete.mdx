A successful deletion returns an empty response body with a 204 status code.

## What Happens When You Delete an Evaluator

1. **Evaluator Removal**: The evaluator is permanently removed from your organization
2. **Historical Data**: Existing evaluation results using this evaluator remain intact
3. **Future Evaluations**: The evaluator can no longer be used for new evaluations
4. **References**: Any references to this evaluator in evaluation configurations will need to be updated

## Before Deleting

Consider these steps before deleting an evaluator:

1. **Check Usage**: Verify if the evaluator is currently being used in any active evaluation workflows
2. **Export Data**: If needed, export any evaluation results or configurations that reference this evaluator
3. **Update References**: Remove or update any evaluation configurations that reference this evaluator
4. **Backup**: Consider creating a backup of the evaluator configuration if you might need it later

## Alternative: Disable Instead of Delete

If you want to temporarily stop using an evaluator without permanently deleting it, consider:

1. **Update the name** to include "[DISABLED]" or similar
2. **Remove it from active evaluation workflows**
3. **Update the description** to indicate it's no longer in use

This approach preserves the evaluator for potential future use while preventing accidental usage.
