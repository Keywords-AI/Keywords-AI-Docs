title: Create logs (batch)
api: POST https://api.keywordsai.co/api/request-logs/batch/create
---

The batch logging endpoint allows you to log multiple requests at once using the **universal input/output design**. This endpoint accepts any span type (chat, embedding, workflow, etc.) and processes them efficiently in batches.

<Info>
You can log up to **5000 requests** at once, and the maximum size of the request is **100MB**.
</Info>

## Request body

<ParamField body="logs" type="array" required>
Array of log objects. Each log object follows the same structure as the single log creation endpoint.

Each log object supports:
- Universal `input` and `output` fields (recommended)
- Legacy `prompt_messages` and `completion_message` fields (backward compatible)
- Any `log_type`: `"chat"`, `"embedding"`, `"workflow"`, `"task"`, etc.

See the [Create Log](/api-endpoints/observe/logs/request-logging-endpoint) documentation for complete field specifications and [log types](/get-started/observability_data_model#log-types) for `log_type` details.
</ParamField>

## Key features

- ✅ **Supports all span types**: Chat, embedding, workflow, transcription, etc.
- ✅ **Mixed types in one batch**: Log different span types in a single request
- ✅ **Automatic field extraction**: System extracts type-specific fields based on `log_type`
- ✅ **Legacy format support**: Both old and new formats work in the same batch

## Response

Returns an array of created log IDs or error details for each log in the batch.
